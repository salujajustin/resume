================================================  =======================

*A Supervised Machine Learning Algorithm for Heart-rate Detection Using Doppler Motion-Sensing Radar*

- Implemented a real time supervised machine learning method to accurately measure heart rate, < 4% error, even if it is weak or overwhelmed by respiratory movement using non-contact Doppler radar
- Designed and manufactured custom photoplethysmogram (PPG) & electrocardiogram (ECG) circuits for ground truth measurement and error analysis
- Developed a user friendly Python wrapper for the NI-USB DAQ series driver to sample, timestamp, and record multiple analog inputs
- Surveyed and compiled a patient database of Doppler radar samples for the scientific community
- Created Interactive GUIs for real time heart beat analysis using dynamic plotting libraries and the Qt interface

*An Optimal Jamming Strategy in a Wireless Ad hoc Network*

- Assessed the feasibility of a binary integer linear program (ILP) algorithm to partition a small < 50-node mobile network with desired mobility model implementation
- Coded and matured mobility models (e.g. Random Waypoint, Random Direction, Reference Point Group Mobility Models) for the performance evaluation of jammer placement and network preservation
- Built and tested autonomous robots under jammed communication environments

*Empirical Verification of Theoretical Models on Performance Characteristics of Micro-Pillar Wick Structures*

- Designed and manufactured support structures for passive heat spreaders
- Analyzed and compared different wick architectures, which was used to design the optimal wick for a given set of conditions

Projects
------------
**VitalSine** - Designed a real time, single-lead ECG monitor for arrhythmia detection. Started from a circuit design to fabrication and eventually launching a real time demo through an iOS application.

**Prime Number Art** - Coded two GPU distributed, probabilistic prime number solvers (Miller-Raben & Lucas probable prime tests) to find large digit prime numbers that form a picture from distant viewing. An elliptic curve primality proving method was used to verify the final prime number.

**Unix Configuration**- A body of Linux/Unix configuration files and scripts that prioritizes fast, lightweight, and asynchronous software development.

**Smart Mirror** - Compiled web APIs and an RSS feed to make a voice activated smart home mirror system using a small system on chip computer to display information such as weather, traffic information, a calendar and reminders.
